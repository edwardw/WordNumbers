## Word numbers: Billion approaches

Not much an UI programmer, I treat [Purescript](http://www.purescript.org/) more as a general purpose programming language. This is my first non-trivial Purescript program.

It tries to re-implement a beautiful Haskell program outlined in a series of blog posts:

  - [part 1](http://conway.rutgers.edu/~ccshan/wiki/blog/posts/WordNumbers1/)
  - [part 2](http://conway.rutgers.edu/~ccshan/wiki/blog/posts/WordNumbers2/)
  - [part 3](http://conway.rutgers.edu/~ccshan/wiki/blog/posts/WordNumbers3/)
  - [part 4](http://conway.rutgers.edu/~ccshan/wiki/blog/posts/WordNumbers4/)

For the logistic part, this project uses `yarn` and `spago` as being recommended [here](https://discourse.purescript.org/t/recommended-tooling-for-purescript-applications-in-2019/948).
